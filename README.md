# 🏗 Backend Engineering Mastery — From Core Java to Spring Boot

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **comprehensive, hands-on backend engineering curriculum** designed to take you from **Java
fundamentals** to building **production-ready APIs with Spring Boot** — the way professional backend engineers work.

It’s split into **modules** that follow a logical learning path.  
Each module contains:

1. 📚 **Topic Readme** — Explains key concepts in a clear, concise way
2. 🔁 **Repeat-Style Assignments** — Short, focused exercises to master the concept
3. 📦 **Mini Project** — A small, real-world-style implementation
4. 🏁 **Capstone** — A larger, combined project at the end of the module

As time goes on, **more modules will be added** to cover advanced topics such as **Spring Security, Microservices,
Databases, Cloud Deployments, and more**.

By the end of this repository, you’ll be able to **design, build, test, and deliver** backend applications that follow
professional standards.
